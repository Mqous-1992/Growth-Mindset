## GROWTH MINDSEST 
### I believe that everyone should improve himself regardless of the condition surrounding him, because self-development depends on the internal conditions of the human being, which must be controlled , not controll us, and the main factor is the amount of development effort.and the great works are performed, not by strength, but by perseverance.which is mean It’s not that being  so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.
### Saying always:
- ***"I CAN "  not   ~~"I CAN'T"~~***
- ***"Do MORE GET MORE"*** 
- ***"I DERSERVE THE BEST"***
